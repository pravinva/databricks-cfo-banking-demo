## 📊 Success Metrics

**Meeting Successful If**:

- ✅ Technical deep-dive scheduled with treasury team
- ✅ Data requirements shared with IT team
- ✅ POC timeline discussed (4-8 weeks)

**Red Flags & Responses**:
- **"We already have this"** → Ask to see their account-level beta modeling (unlikely they have it)
- **"Too complex for our team"** → Position as no-code solution for business users, technical once, self-service always
- **"We can't share data"** → Discuss data privacy (runs in their Azure/AWS, FedRAMP certified)
